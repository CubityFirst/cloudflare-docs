## Compound Words

## Whitespace

Some are fairly frequent in our blog posts and product content. For the sake of consistency, we need to follow these conventions when using them:

| Cloudflare conventions |
|-----------|------------|
|✅ nameserver| Change your nameservers to Cloudflare’s.|
|❌ name server|
|--------------|--------------------------|
✅ hostname
❌ host name

Add a *. SAN (wildcard) to the custom hostname certificate.

✅ data center
❌ datacenter

Cloudflare updates the new setting across all of our data centers around the world.

✅ checkbox
❌ check box	Select the Transfer lock checkbox before continuing the setup.
