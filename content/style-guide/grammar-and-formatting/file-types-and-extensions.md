## File Types and Extensions

You can refer both to file types and file extensions in documentation:

Referring to file types: Accepted file formats are JSON and YAML. 
Referring to file extensions: Upload the `.txt` file to the dashboard.

When referring to a specific file type, always:

+ use regular text formatting
+ write the file type in uppercase
+ avoid the initial dot (you're referring to the file type, not the file extension)

When referring to a specific extension, always:

+ monospace the file extension
+ include a dot
+ write the extension in lowercase
+ always specify a noun after mentioning a file extension, e.g. "file" or "file extension". Don't leave the extension hanging
    + ✅Download the `.txt` file.
    + ❌Download the `.txt`.

Other examples:

The accepted file formats are YAML (files with a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension) and JSON (files with a `.json` file extension).
Additionally, this plist can be wrapped in a `.mobileconfig` file.
If you'd like to test how this feature works, here is a sample `.csv` file.
Concatenate the string to a text-based `.pem` file.
